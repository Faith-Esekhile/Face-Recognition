**Overview**

This project is an automated attendance system that uses facial recognition to identify and record individuals in real-time. It leverages OpenCV for image processing and Dlib for face detection and encoding, providing a seamless, contactless attendance experience.
How It Works

The system captures live video from a webcam.

Dlib detects and encodes facial features.

OpenCV compares live faces with stored encodings.

When a match is found, the person’s name and timestamp are recorded automatically.

**Technologies Used**

Python

OpenCV – for image capture and processing

Dlib – for face detection and recognition


**Future Improvements**

Integrate with HR system
NumPy & Pandas – for data handling and HR analytics
